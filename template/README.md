2. ` npm install `

 - ` ./csb/mvn install [clean] [-DskipTests] `
4. ` ./csb/csb-webapp/mvn jetty:run ` to start the application

- `webdriver-manager update` to make sure you have at least 2.45.0 version
- `webdriver-manager start` to have a working session hub on ` http://localhost:4444 ` (or distant if so)
- `npm test` or `npm run teste2e` for all tests or just e2e tests

### Commands available

- Default testing, run all test cases and coverage: ` npm test `,
- Test CORE and Project modules only, check code coverage: ` npm run testmodules `
- Run E2E tests on working application: ` npm run teste2e `
